## Lending Overview

Track money you've lent to others and borrowed from sources.

### Why Track Lending?

- **Remember who owes you** - Never forget about money you've lent
- **Track what you owe** - Stay on top of your debts
- **See repayment history** - Know who's reliable
- **Plan your finances** - Factor in expected repayments

### Two Directions

**Money You've Lent (Receivables)**
- Friends and family loans
- Business advances
- Informal lending

**Money You've Borrowed (Payables)**
- Personal loans
- SACCO loans
- Family borrowings
- Salary advances

### The Lending Dashboard

### Best Practices

1. Always record loans immediately
