## Creating a Budget

A budget helps you control spending and reach your financial goals faster.

### Why Budget?

- **Control spending** - Know where every shilling goes
- **Avoid overspending** - Get alerts before you exceed limits
- **Save more** - Allocate money to savings first
- **Reduce stress** - No more end-of-month money worries

### How to Create a Budget

1. Go to **Budget** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Budget**
3. For each category, set:
   - **Monthly Limit** - Maximum you want to spend
   - **Priority** - How important is this category?
4. Review your total budget vs. income
5. Click **Save**

### Budget Categories

Set limits for categories like:
- Food & Groceries
- Transport
- Utilities
- Entertainment
- Shopping
- Personal Care

### The 50/30/20 Rule

A popular budgeting framework:
- **50% Needs** - Rent, food, utilities, transport
- **30% Wants** - Entertainment, dining out, hobbies
- **20% Savings** - Emergency fund, goals, investments

### Monthly Reset

Your budget resets at the start of each month:
- Unused amounts don't roll over
- Start fresh with your limits
- Review last month's performance

### Start With Your Net Salary

After PAYE, NHIF, and NSSF deductions, budget from what actually hits your account.

### Account for Matatu Fare Increases

Transport costs can spike during:
- Rainy seasons

Budget 10-20% extra for transport.

- Budget the extra income deliberately

### Emergency Fund First

Before investing or goals:
- Build 3-6 months expenses
- Keep in accessible account
- Only use for true emergencies

### Chama Contributions

If you're in a chama:
- Budget for contributions as a fixed expense
- Don't touch your chama share for monthly expenses
- Consider it part of your savings
