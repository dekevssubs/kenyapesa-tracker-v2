## Setting Savings Goals

Goals give your savings a purpose and keep you motivated.

### Why Set Goals?

- **Clarity** - Know exactly what you're saving for
- **Prioritization** - Allocate money to what matters most
- **Discipline** - Resist the temptation to spend

### Types of Goals

**Short-term (< 1 year)**

- New phone

**Medium-term (1-3 years)**
- Deposit for car

### Creating a Goal

1. Go to **Goals** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Goal**
3. Enter:
   - **Name** - What are you saving for?
   - **Target Amount** - How much do you need?
   - **Target Date** - When do you want to achieve it?
   - **Account** - Where will you save?

## Contributing to Goals

Regular contributions are the key to reaching your goals.

### Ways to Contribute

**Manual Contributions**
- Add lump sums whenever you have extra money
- Great for bonuses, gifts, or windfalls

**Linked to Income**
- Automatically allocate a portion of income
- "Pay yourself first" approach

**Transfer from Accounts**
- Move money from spending to savings account
- Create a dedicated goal account

### Setting Up Automatic Savings

1. When adding income (salary), allocate to goals
2. Set a percentage or fixed amount
3. This creates a contribution automatically

### Contribution Tips

**Consistency Over Amount**
- Small regular amounts beat irregular large ones
- Ksh 500/week = Ksh 26,000/year

**Increase Gradually**
- Start with what you can afford
- Increase by 10% each raise

**Windfall Strategy**
- Bonus: Save 50%, spend 50%
- Tax refund: All to goals
- Gift money: At least half to goals

### When to Pause

It's okay to pause contributions if:
- You have a genuine emergency
- You lose income temporarily
- You need to clear expensive debt

But always resume as soon as possible!
