Here’s a **comprehensive breakdown of the M-Pesa services in Kenya** along with their **associated billing charges (fees)** — **excluding government utilities and STK Push (Lipa na M-Pesa Online)**. The fees below reflect the *current 2025 tariff structures* as published by Safaricom and consolidated from reliable sources. ([Kenyantimes][1])

## 💸 1) **Person-to-Person Transfers (P2P)**

Sending money from your M-Pesa wallet to another M-Pesa user or to a Business Till is charged based on the amount:

| Amount (KES)                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Fee (KES) |

| 2,501 – 3,500                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 53        |
| 3,501 – 5,000                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 57        |

| 7,501 – 10,000                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 90        |
| 10,001 – 15,000                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 100       |
| 15,001 – 20,000                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 105       |
| 20,001 – 35,000                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 108       |
| 35,001 – 250,000                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 108       |
| **Notes:** • Sending to other registered mobile wallets (e.g., Airtel Money, T-Kash) uses these same bands. • You cannot send above **KSh 250,000 per transaction** and the **daily limit is KSh 500,000**. ([Kenyantimes][1]) |           |

---

## 💰 2) **Cash Transactions**

### 🏦 a) **Withdrawals from M-Pesa Agents**

Fees depend on the amount you cash out:

| Amount (KES)     | Fee (KES) |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| 50 – 100         | 11        |
| 101 – 500        | 29        |
| 501 – 1,000      | 29        |
| 1,001 – 1,500    | 29        |
| 1,501 – 2,500    | 29        |
| 2,501 – 3,500    | 52        |
| 3,501 – 5,000    | 69        |
| 5,001 – 7,500    | 87        |
| 7,501 – 10,000   | 115       |
| 10,001 – 15,000  | 167       |
| 15,001 – 20,000  | 185       |
| 20,001 – 35,000  | 197       |
| 35,001 – 50,000  | 278       |
| 50,001 – 250,000 | 309       |

**Minimum withdrawal amount is KSh 50.** ([Kenyantimes][1])

### 🏧 b) **ATM Withdrawals**

Different tariff from agents:

| Amount (KES)    | Fee (KES) |
| --------------- | --------- |
| 200 – 2,500     | 35        |
| 2,501 – 5,000   | 69        |
| 5,001 – 10,000  | 115       |
| 10,001 – 35,000 | 203       |

*(Note: ATM charging may include additional bank/third-party fees.)* ([Safaricom][2])

---

## 🛍️ 3) **Buy Goods (Business Till)**

* **Customers are charged 0 fees** for most Buy Goods payments (payments to a Till number).
* Businesses *may* be charged a small percentage commission (approximately up to ~0.5% capped at a certain amount per transaction) depending on the merchant tariff plan. ([Safaricom][3])

---

## 🧾 4) **PayBill Payments**

PayBill charges depend on amount and tariff subtype (Customer, Business, Mgao). In general:

### 📌 Customer Pays All Fees (most common)

| Amount (KES)  | Customer Fee                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 – 100       | FREE                                                                      |
| 101 – 250,000 | **varies (~5 – 108 KES)** based on amount band (similar structure to P2P) |

> Safaricom’s PayBill fees are usually linked to the same banded structure that applies to transfers — roughly 0 to 108 KES on larger amounts — and may be shared or borne by business depending on tariff arrangement. ([Tuko.co.ke - Kenya news.][4])

*(Tips: Use PayBill to handle structured bill payments from customers. Fee sharing options exist but vary by merchant setup.)*

---

## 🏦 5) **Bank Transfers**

* **M-Pesa → Bank Account**: There may be a small fee (varies by bank), but in recent M-Pesa tariff structures sending to banks is often treated like a transfer with minimal to moderate fees (similar to P2P bands or a bank-specific fee).
* **Bank → M-Pesa**: Often free or subject to bank fees (not Safaricom). *(Note: exact bank charges vary.)*

📌 You should confirm the specific bank fees in the “My Safaricom App” or bank tariff guide.

---

## 📈 6) **M-Shwari (Loans & Savings)**

M-Shwari is a banking product *within* M-Pesa and has separate fees:

### 🔹 **Loan Charges**

* A **one-off facility fee of ~7.5% of the loan amount** plus applicable excise duty (typically ~1.5%) is charged when a loan is disbursed. ([Safaricom][5])

### 🔹 **Savings**

* **No charge** to deposit or move money between M-Pesa and M-Shwari. Savings can earn interest, and there are usually no transaction fees for savings movement. ([NCBA Group][6])

*(Note: Specific charges, interest, and terms are set by NCBA Bank under M-Shwari terms.)*

---

## ⏱️ 7) **Fuliza (Overdraft)**

Fuliza lets you complete transactions even with insufficient balance, but **fees apply**:

### 📍 **Fuliza Charges**

* **Access fee:** ~**1%** of the amount you use (one-off).
* **Daily maintenance fee:** Charged on outstanding balance daily. Amount varies by the overdraft amount (small to large bands).
* Some promotional/waiver structures exist (e.g., first few days free on small sums). ([Safaricom][7])

**Example Structure (indicative):**

* 101–500 KES outstanding → ~2.5 KES + excise duty daily
* 501–1,000 KES → ~5 KES + excise daily
  *(Actual fees vary by outstanding band and repayment timing.)* ([Safaricom][7])

📌 Fuliza is repaid automatically once you top up your M-Pesa balance.

---

## 🆓 **Free or Zero Fees (Common)**

These are typically free (no Safaricom fee):

* Deposits into M-Pesa wallet at agents
* Receiving money into your M-Pesa account
* Buying airtime (self/others)
* Balance enquiry
* Changing M-Pesa PIN
* Sending KSh **1–100** to another registered user
* Buy Goods (Till) for customers (in most cases) ([Kenyantimes][1])

---

---

## 2️⃣ Core Tariff Logic (Authoritative Rules)

### A) **Send Money (P2P) – Fee Bands**

| Amount (KES)   | Fee |
| -------------- | --- |
| 1–100          | 0   |
| 101–500        | 7   |
| 501–1,000      | 13  |
| 1,001–1,500    | 23  |
| 1,501–2,500    | 33  |
| 2,501–3,500    | 53  |
| 3,501–5,000    | 57  |
| 5,001–7,500    | 78  |
| 7,501–10,000   | 90  |
| 10,001–15,000  | 100 |
| 15,001–250,000 | 108 |

```
fee = lookupP2P(amount)
```

---

### B) **Withdraw Cash – Agent**

| Amount   | Fee |
| -------- | --- |
| ≤100     | 11  |
| ≤1,500   | 29  |
| ≤3,500   | 52  |
| ≤5,000   | 69  |
| ≤7,500   | 87  |
| ≤10,000  | 115 |
| ≤15,000  | 167 |
| ≤20,000  | 185 |
| ≤35,000  | 197 |
| ≤250,000 | 309 |

---

### C) **ATM Withdrawal**

| Amount  | Fee |
| ------- | --- |
| ≤2,500  | 35  |
| ≤5,000  | 69  |
| ≤10,000 | 115 |
| ≤35,000 | 203 |

---

### D) **Buy Goods (Till)**

```
fee = 0
```

---

### E) **PayBill (Customer Pays)**

Uses **same banding as Send Money** unless overridden:

```
fee = lookupP2P(amount)
```

---

### F) **Bank Transfer (M-Pesa → Bank)**

Typically **flat or banded** (example structure):

| Amount  | Fee |
| ------- | --- |
| ≤10,000 | 50  |
| ≤50,000 | 100 |
| >50,000 | 150 |

*(Exact values configurable per bank — keep this table editable.)*

---

## 3️⃣ Excise Duty Handling (Important)

Kenya applies **excise duty (currently 15%)** on **transaction fees**, not on the amount.

```
excise = fee × 0.15
```

> ❗ Buy Goods (Till) → no fee → no excise
> ❗ Deposits → excluded

---

## 4️⃣ Final Calculation Formula

```
Total Debited = Amount + Fee + Excise
Recipient Gets = Amount
```

---

## 5️⃣ Example Output (UI)

### Example: Send Money – KES 3,000

```
Fee:           53.00
Excise (15%):   7.95
--------------------
Total Charges: 60.95
Total Debited: 3,060.95
Recipient Gets: 3,000.00
```

---

## 6️⃣ Internal Data Structure (Clean & Maintainable)

```json
{
  "SEND_MONEY": [
    { "max": 100, "fee": 0 },
    { "max": 500, "fee": 7 },
    { "max": 1000, "fee": 13 },
    { "max": 1500, "fee": 23 },
    { "max": 2500, "fee": 33 },
    { "max": 3500, "fee": 53 },
    { "max": 5000, "fee": 57 },
    { "max": 7500, "fee": 78 },
    { "max": 10000, "fee": 90 },
    { "max": 15000, "fee": 100 },
    { "max": 250000, "fee": 108 }
  ]
}
```
